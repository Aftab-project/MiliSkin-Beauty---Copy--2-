Stretch Mark Resurfacing
Stretch Mark Resurfacing with Fractional RF + Microneedling is an advanced corrective treatment designed to visibly improve the appearance of stretch marks by repairing weakened skin structure, tightening tissue, and smoothing texture. This powerful dual-technology approach combines precision microneedling with fractional radiofrequency energy to target stretch marks at multiple skin depths.
Microneedling creates controlled micro-channels that stimulate natural collagen and elastin production while preparing the skin for deeper repair. Fractional RF then delivers heat into the dermis to remodel damaged fibres, strengthen skin density, and tighten stretched tissue. Together, they correct texture irregularities, soften visible lines, and help stretch marks blend seamlessly with surrounding skin.
Suitable for stomach, hips, thighs, buttocks, breasts, arms, and lower back, and effective on both newer red stretch marks and older white or textured marks.

Step-by-Step Experience
Step 1: Skin Assessment & Treatment Planning
Stretch marks are assessed for depth, texture, and skin laxity to customise treatment intensity.
Step 2: Skin Preparation
The area is cleansed and prepped to optimise microneedling penetration and RF energy delivery.
Step 3: Microneedling Skin Correction
Precision microneedling creates micro-channels to stimulate collagen, improve skin texture, and initiate repair.
Step 4: Fractional RF Remodeling
Fractional RF energy is delivered through the skin to heat deeper layers, tightening tissue and rebuilding weakened skin fibres.
Step 5: Soothing Recovery & Barrier Support
Calming, restorative products are applied to reduce sensitivity and support healing.

Green Peel – Bio Microneedling 
The Green Peel is a natural, herbal-based skin resurfacing treatment that stimulates the skin’s regeneration using plant-derived ingredients instead of chemical acids. Suitable for face, neck, décolleté, and body areas, it boosts circulation, accelerates cell turnover, and strengthens the skin from within. A specialised herbal blend is massaged into the skin, acting as a natural micro-exfoliator to target acne, pigmentation, sun damage, uneven texture, and enlarged pores. Depending on the strength chosen, mild to visible peeling may occur over the following days, revealing smoother, brighter, and more refined skin. A soothing mask and healing serum are applied during the session, with take-home serum to maintain hydration and support optimal skin regeneration throughout the peeling and renewal phase.

Gentle cleanse to remove impurities and prep the skin for maximum absorption.
